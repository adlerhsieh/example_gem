# Example

This is my first gem. This gem simply generates a "The gem works" string.

Installing locally by adding the following line in the gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'example', :path => "/whatever/path/you/have/from/your/root"
```

And don't forget to:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Add the following line in whatever situation:

```ruby
Example.build
```

and "The gem works!" will appear.
